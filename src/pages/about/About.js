      As a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for music, I thrive at the intersection of technology and art. I will soon be completing a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Denver Coding Boot Camp, where I honed my skills in creative problem-solving and design. With a desire to create innovative tools for modern music production, such as DAWs, soft synths, and audio plugins, I am driven to make a meaningful impact in the music industry, and I am driven by a desire to create innovative solutions that enhance people's lives.
